# Pandu Workspace - A RAG Chatbot 🐼

A conversational RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge workspace built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Next.js, and modern LLM orchestration techniques.

Pandu Workspace allows users to create a knowledge base, ask conversational questions over documents, and receive grounded AI-generated responses with source attribution and streaming support.

# 🧠 Core RAG Concepts Implemented

This project focuses heavily on understanding and implementing core RAG engineering concepts instead of only building a simple chatbot UI.

Implemented concepts include:

- Embedding generation
- Vector similarity search
- Chunking strategies
- Hybrid retrieval
- Retrieval reranking
- Query rewriting
- Conversational memory optimization
- Streaming architecture
- Source attribution
- Retrieval debugging & observability

# ⚙️ Tech Stack

## Backend
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- pgvector
- SQLAlchemy
- Sentence Transformers
- Groq API

## Frontend (Different Repo)
- Next.js

# 🗄️ PostgreSQL + pgvector Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search.

You can run PostgreSQL in multiple ways:

- Local PostgreSQL installation
- Docker
- Hosted PostgreSQL providers (Neon, Supabase, Railway, etc.)

---

## Enable pgvector Extension

Run the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

---

## Example Database URL

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/pandu_workspace
```

# 🔍 Retrieval Pipeline

## 1. Query Rewriting

Conversational questions are rewritten into standalone queries using previous chat history and conversational context.

Example:

```text
"What about his favorite food?"
↓
"What is Pandu's favorite food?"
```

This significantly improves retrieval quality in conversational flows.

---

## 2. Vector Search

The rewritten query is embedded and matched against document chunk embeddings stored in PostgreSQL using pgvector cosine similarity search.

---

## 3. Hybrid Reranking

Retrieved chunks are reranked using lightweight keyword overlap scoring on top of semantic similarity.

This helps improve retrieval precision for keyword-heavy queries.

---

## 4. Context Assembly

Top ranked chunks are combined into contextual information for the LLM.

---

## 5. Streaming Responses

Responses are streamed token-by-token from the backend to provide real-time AI chat experience.

---

## 6. Source Attribution

Retrieved documents are attached to responses so users can verify answers and navigate to original documents.

---

# 🧠 Conversational Memory Optimization

To avoid infinite token growth:

- Older conversations are summarized
- Recent messages are retained
- Query rewriting uses:
  - summarized memory
  - recent conversational history

This helps maintain conversational continuity while keeping prompts efficient.

---

# 📡 Streaming Architecture

The application uses streaming responses from the backend to create a responsive AI chat experience.

Currently:
- answer tokens stream live
- document sources are returned via HTTP headers

Future improvements may include full SSE (Server-Sent Events) architecture.

---

# 🖥️ UI Features

- Fixed navbar layout
- Auto-scrolling chat
- Streaming assistant responses
- Source pills with document linking
- Responsive dark UI
- Panda branding 😄
